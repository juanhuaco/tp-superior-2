# Solving Systems of Equations - Python Code
## Overview
This project consists of Python code that implements various methods for solving both linear and nonlinear systems of equations, as outlined in the exercises. The methods include direct and iterative approaches, and the code allows for graphical analysis of the results.

The exercises focus on:

Nonlinear Systems - Extending the Newton-Raphson method and comparing it to Newtonâ€™s method in terms of computational cost and precision.
Linear Systems - Using the Van der Monde matrix and applying methods like Gaussian elimination, back substitution, and Gauss-Seidel.
